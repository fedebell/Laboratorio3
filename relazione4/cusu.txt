It follows from Sect. 10.22 that we can write $P^\mu = (d{\bf p}, dE/c)$, where $d{\bf p}$ and $dE$ are the total momentum and energy carried off by the radiation emitted between times $t=0$ and $t=dt$, respectively. As we have already mentioned, $d{\bf p} = 0$ in the instantaneous rest frame $S$. Transforming to an arbitrary inertial frame $S'$, in which the instantaneous velocity of the charge is $u$, we obtain \begin{displaymath} dE = \gamma(u) \left(dE + u dp^1\right) = \gamma dE. \end{displaymath} \begin{displaymath} dE^{'} = \gamma(u) \left(dE + u dp^1\right) = \gamma dE. \end{displaymath}
